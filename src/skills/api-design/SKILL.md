# API Design

Make consumer-visible semantics explicit enough that providers and consumers do not have to guess.

## Workflow

1. Identify the consumer job, domain terms, authority, sensitivity, and failure modes.
2. Choose the interface shape that fits the interaction: request/response, query, command, event, webhook, or stream.
3. Define representation semantics: identifiers, absent vs null, defaults, enums, timestamps/units, ordering, filtering, and pagination.
4. For mutations, define validation, preconditions, idempotency scope, concurrency behavior, partial outcomes, long-running operations, and retry-safe errors.
5. For async contracts, define delivery/duplicate/order semantics and how consumers detect gaps or replay.
6. Evaluate compatibility from each consumer perspective and plan additive evolution/deprecation where possible.
7. Keep implementation framework and storage details out of the public contract unless they are intentionally part of it.

## Stop

Stop when a consumer can implement correctly without guessing success, failure, retry, compatibility, or data semantics.
