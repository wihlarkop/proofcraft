  Review a code or change diff against intended behavior, repository standards, and relevant risk
  domains. Use for explicit PR/diff/design review. Default to read-only unless fixes are
  requested. Validate suspicious findings before reporting them, compose only concerns touched by
  the diff, and prioritize actionable evidence-backed issues instead of speculative commentary.

# Review

Review the intended change, not the entire software universe.

## Entry

Default to read-only review. Modify code only when the user explicitly asks for fixes or the active workflow has already authorized remediation.

## Workflow

1. Understand intended behavior from the request/spec/plan and inspect the actual diff. When Git exists, check newly tracked paths and file-count/path anomalies; inspect untracked files when they affect the review claim. Use `references/_shared/engineering/diff-discipline.md` for repository hygiene, preserving unrelated work.
2. Determine which risk domains the diff truly touches. Compose only those specialist concerns.
3. Check correctness, compatibility, failure behavior, tests/evidence, repository conventions, and materially relevant current technology usage at the affected boundaries. When judging whether evidence is adequate for browser/UI, HTTP/GraphQL, RPC/gRPC, async/event, persistence, CLI, or device/runtime claims, use `references/_shared/verification/verification-surfaces.md`; a green test at the wrong surface does not prove the claim. Validate deprecated, legacy, unsupported, or non-idiomatic usage against the selected version and primary guidance when version sensitivity matters; do not turn personal style preference into a finding.
4. Validate suspicious findings in surrounding code or direct evidence before reporting them.
5. Prioritize material, actionable findings. Distinguish blockers from improvements and avoid style churn already covered by automated tooling.

A green test suite is evidence, not proof that the implementation matches the intended contract.

## Outputs

A concise set of prioritized findings with file/location/evidence where available, plus an explicit no-material-findings result when appropriate.

## Stop

Stop when the material diff and relevant risk domains have been reviewed. Do not invent findings to fill a quota or launch unrelated refactoring.
